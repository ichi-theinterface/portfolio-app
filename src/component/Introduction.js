        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Ichiro and I enjoy learning technology related to IT. 
            I started my career in IT two years ago as customer support tech. 
            Since then, I experienced in wide range of positions related computer networking 
            such as administrator for enterprises and scaling technician for cloud/internet service providers. 
            What I love about IT is that more I learn I find more things I do not know!! </p>
        <p>Recently, I have strong interest in programing becaseuse I believe it opens up the door for my career. 
            For the next step, I hope to work for site reliability engineering or web front-end development.  
        </p>
